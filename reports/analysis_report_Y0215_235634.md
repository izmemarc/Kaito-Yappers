Shoutout to my Doodles token post (that was not intended to be FUD but certainly seems like everyone thought it was) and a highlight on Polkadot adding a post-TGE yap board for the continued up-only counter. TGE feels sooner than we anticipated...and I think that's bullish." [Link](https://x.com/beast_ico/status/1890473514538275297)

- to-date that has net me: • a core position with @megaeth_labs • a role with @modernmarket_ • one bajillion dollars from $kaito. [link to tweet](https://x.com/0xbreadguy/status/1890472390280327462)
- deleted the last header because it represented 0.7c as $0.7 for median fees. i can live with $0.07 <-> $0.007 difference but $0.7 is egregious. [link to tweet](https://x.com/0xbreadguy/status/1890524744769761408)
