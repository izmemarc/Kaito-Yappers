What's Yappening

### VitalikButerin | 0.96%

### waleswoosh | 0.69%

- looks like the owner of the wallet 0x83d did some old-school insider trading. they loaded up a new wallet with 10 eth and spent valentine's day sweeping an nft collection called 'alphasharks'...what's interesting is that before the 0x83d sweep, there was virtually no activity in the collection.

- the opensea xp farming season for the $sea airdrop is leading to some pretty wild trading activity. this bored ape was sold 18 (!) times today. 4 of these sales all took place within 5 minutes, with each farmer immediately dumping on the next one as soon as their bid was triggered. [link to tweet](https://x.com/waleswoosh/status/1890819862722719779)
- it looks like yuga labs is consolidating its projects to focus on the core nft collections. many projects have already been sold to third party companies...i think it’s a good strategy to focus back on apes and otherside, do you agree?

- calculated the total extracted from memes on solana: - trading bots & apps: 1.09bn - pumpfun: 492m - mev: 1.5-2bn - trump insiders: 0.5-1bn - other insiders: unknown - amms: 0-2bn total: 3.6-6.6+ bn [source](https://x.com/0xngmi/status/1890783855054831910)
- in a paper that analyses us spending habits, they found that for every 1$ spent on gambling, 0.99$ less was spent on long term investments, with outsized effects among poor households [source](https://x.com/0xngmi/status/1890708635208282326)
- in the previous cycle, opensea + nft royalties extracted ~3bn but then you had wealth creation events such as bored ape ecosystem (>10bn at the top) or defi tokens like aave, which offset some of that [source](https://x.com/0xngmi/status/1890841095992471995)

- since i know a number of people are down bad bad after the last couple weeks, i’ll share a value spot for free. look at avax eco and polkadot. avax looks like institutional qe…which means they’re incentivizing user activity….which generally means easy money.
