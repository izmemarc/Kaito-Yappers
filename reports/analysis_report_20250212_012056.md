- crazy idea: a hackathon for the arbitrum community but the prizes aren’t cash, they’re token delegations. [link](https://x.com/sgoldfed/status/1889086072346296643)
- it’s a new era for arbitrum. buckle up. lock in. win. [link](https://x.com/sgoldfed/status/1889096929881301080)

- "The fact that the Arbitrum DAO (1) receives 100% of fees to its transparent on-chain treasury (2) is community controlled (3) and the community has elected not to sell any ETH to date is not a distraction." [Link](https://x.com/sgoldfed/status/1889036378027212957)
### capnjackbearow | 0.515%

- berachain inflation is fundamentally misunderstood. remember, 100% of pos inflation is in bgt. inflation is only realized when bgt is burned to bera. [link to tweet](https://x.com/capnjackbearow/status/1889031590560608401)
- so, if bgt apy is growing faster than inflation, folks won't burn & inflation isn't realized. plus, as more stake comes online (next few days, inflation top line drops). [link to tweet](https://x.com/capnjackbearow/status/1889031590560608401)
- in periods of market volatility where incentive rates could drop off hard, that would result in a larger percentage being burned, including historical inflation. [link to tweet](https://x.com/capnjackbearow/status/1889031590560608401)

- some easy ways to upgrade crypto ux: > rename 'bridging' to 'transferring' > rename 'chain' to 'network' > rename 'intents' to 'preconditions'... [link to tweet](https://x.com/divine_economy/status/1889052438314770470)
- everyone is complaining that toly isn't trading millions otc on solana... private onchain otc requires a chain that can actually support privacy between two parties like @0xpolygonmiden [link to tweet](https://x.com/divine_economy/status/1889055951287918810)
