- what did you do on valentine's day? looks like the owner of the wallet 0x83d did some old-school insider trading. they loaded up a new wallet with 10 eth and spent valentine's day sweeping an nft collection called 'alphasharks'.

- in a paper that analyses us spending habits, they found that for every 1$ spent on gambling, 0.99$ less was spent on long term investments... this worries me because i believe crypto is path dependent, and if a large part of society ends up seeing crypto as net bad because of memecoin's effects... [source](https://x.com/0xngmi/status/1890708635208282326)
- in the previous cycle, opensea + nft royalties extracted ~3bn... if all coins are zero sum, you need huge inflows to sustain this [source](https://x.com/0xngmi/status/1890841095992471995)

- two updates went into the bnb chain in the last few hours. if you want to read a human-understandable version, here is the blog: [link](https://x.com/cz_binance/status/1890818516011376664). more to come. build!
- interesting thread. i'm not sure of its accuracy, but there are lots of details. it shows: 1. you should be very careful before endorsing a token. 2. token economics matter. unlocking schedules matter. a lot of research has to be done beforehand. 3. buying new tokens is inherently risky. 4. there is a lot of money ready to invest. this could have been a substantial opportunity for argentina if it had been managed well...

- this is julian peh, the singapore based ceo of kip protocol. he stole over $100m from us yesterday in a $4b rug of the javier milei promoted $libra token. also involved is his partner, dr. jennifer dodgson. [link to tweet](https://x.com/beaniemaxi/status/1890742923299311862)
- lets not forget that $libra was listed by moonshot, which was clearly provided with advance info of the launch. after the insiders extracted $100m of liquidity from the token, moonshoot delisted it. [link to tweet](https://x.com/beaniemaxi/status/1890826661492297758)
- kip is now blatantly lying and saying it only got involved post launch with $libra. the official website was online prior to the token launch and it has all the token details, including the tokenomics and the ca. [link to tweet](https://x.com/beaniemaxi/status/1890854580889456756)

- one of the optimizations we've made is reducing the metadata 'weight' of blocks within ~1s intervals. every 1s: full-metadata block. between those blocks (10ms intervals): 'mini' blocks. [link](https://x.com/0xbreadguy/status/1890584158881345866)
- memecoin crime szn has led to the dogfooding and direct benefit/adoption of solana mobile... people began airdropping to these phones, which led to a sellout of not just the first iteration but the second. [link](https://x.com/0xbreadguy/status/1890840712092266642)
- i've taken solana crime szn into my own hands. @aeyakovenko plz approve my pr to the official solana github to make your chain pure once more. [link](https://x.com/0xbreadguy/status/1890818624870306268)

- remember the unwinding of the yen carry trade? banks were down. tradfi markets were in chaos. but defi? flawless execution. so why wasn’t this the moment defi took over? [link to tweet](https://x.com/laurashin/status/1890553184940073259)

- the return to fundamentals will be glorious. [link to tweet](https://x.com/ayyyeandy/status/1890781925037457732)
- bring back the crypto investing era when being early wasn’t about being first to ape garbage on launch day, rather developing a thesis and believing in something while holding for years. [link to tweet](https://x.com/ayyyeandy/status/1890840171412603201)

- my thoughts on libra and solana: it's not solana's fault that a coin launched and effectively rugged... the initial reaction from solana leaders on the timeline has been poor and not inspiring confidence. [link to tweet](https://x.com/tyler_did_it/status/1890776392914346439)
